By late November, Nvidia owned just over 500,000 shares of the company.\\n\\nToday, Ark Invest holds just 390,000 shares across its suite of next-generation technology ETFs. The stock is not in its flagship Disruptive Innovation fund.\\n\\nRough calculations by Insider suggest Ark Invest left more than $200 million in potential profits on the table when it sold down its Nvidia stake throughout the end of last year. \\n\\nArk\\'s ill-timed share sale of Nvidia highlights the difficulties of actively managing a portfolio of disruption-focused investments, because even if you pick the right theme to invest in, there\\'s no guarantee you\\'ll pick the right companies to bet on.\\n\\n**In February, Wood said Ark\\'s wave of Nvidia sales was in part because its valuation was \"very high\" and that it was consolidating its portfolio into higher conviction names.**\\n\\n\"We like Nvidia, we think it\\'s going to be a good stock. It\\'s priced, it\\'s the \\'check-the-box\\' AI company. For a flagship fund, where we\\'re consolidated towards our highest conviction names, part of that has to do with the valuation,\" she told CNBC on February 27.\\n\\nWood is instead counting on UiPath for Ark Invest\\'s exposure to artificial intelligence, which is its second largest position across all of its ETFs. Meanwhile, Tesla remains Ark Invest\\'s top holding, which is also working on artificial intelligence to help enable its self-driving technology. \\n\\nBut despite the hype in AI this year, those two stocks have only captured some of the year-to-date gains seen across the space. Shares of UIPath are up just 14% year-to-date, while Tesla stock is up an impressive 50%. \\n\\nShares of Ark Invest\\'s Disruptive Innovation ETF were down 2.7% on Thursday, despite the Nasdaq 100 jumping 1.7%. \\n\\nhttps://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/cathie-wood-ark-invest-sold-nvidia-stake-before-ai-rally-2023-5?'"
